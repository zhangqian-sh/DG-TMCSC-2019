Code up DG scheme

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &u_x = f,\quad 0\leq x\leq 1\\
    &u(0) = a
\end{aligned}
$$

for $f(x)=\cos(x)$, $a=0$ (The exact solution is $u(x)=\sin(x)$.) for $k=0,1,2$; $h=\frac{1}{10},\frac{1}{20},\frac{1}{40},\cdots,\frac{1}{320}$.

Document $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ errors and orders of accuracy.
